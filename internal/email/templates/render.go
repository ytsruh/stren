// Package emailtmpl holds the email-specific Templ components and
// their render helpers. It is a sibling of the email package
// (internal/email) by Go's directory = package rule; the parent
// package imports this one to render emails.
//
// All HTML in this package is designed for email-client
// compatibility. The rules are stricter than for web pages:
//
//   - Layout uses <table> with role="presentation", cellpadding,
//     cellspacing, and border attributes. CSS flex/grid does not
//     work in Outlook (Word rendering engine) and is unreliable in
//     older mobile clients.
//   - Every visible style is inline (style="..."). <style> blocks
//     are stripped by Gmail and most other webmail clients.
//   - No JavaScript. No htmx. No external CSS or fonts loaded from
//     the network — recipients may have images off by default, and
//     any third-party request also leaks their open to the
//     tracker.
//   - MSO conditional comments wrap the table layout so Outlook
//     falls back to a fixed-width rendering when its CSS engine
//     is not used.
//   - Colors are hard-coded hex values. oklch() (used by the web
//     app) is not supported in most email clients.
//
// The plaintext part of each email is produced by sibling
// Go functions in render.go, not by templ — the plaintext path
// has none of the above constraints and templ would be overkill.
