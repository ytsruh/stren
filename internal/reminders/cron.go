// Package reminders contains the scheduled jobs that run in the
// background while the server is up. The package owns the only
// place in the codebase that imports a third-party scheduler
// (github.com/robfig/cron/v3); everything else in the package
// talks to a narrow Scheduler interface so the dep is easy to
// replace with a different runner (a real queue, a system cron,
// an HTTP trigger, etc.) without touching the job code.
//
// The job code itself is decoupled from the cron wrapper: the
// WeightReminder struct exposes a plain Run(ctx) method that the
// cron job calls. Tests can call Run directly without standing
// up a scheduler. Conversely, the Scheduler is testable with a
// fake job function in the rare case we want to exercise the
// cron lifecycle in isolation.

//   - Start: begin firing jobs on their schedule. Safe to

//   - Stop:  stop firing and wait for any in-flight job to
//     return. Safe to call multiple times; subsequent calls
//     are a no-op.
//
// The Stop semantics — wait for in-flight work to finish —
// match robfig/cron/v3's contract. A future implementation
// behind this interface should preserve that contract so
// callers can rely on Stop() returning only when it is safe
// to exit the process.
